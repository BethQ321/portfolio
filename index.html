        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
        After college, I became a high school teacher.  I enjoyed helping students to develop their logic and problem solving skills as well as creating a curriculum that would challenge them.  I am looking forward to using those problem solving skills myself that I taught for many years.
        </p>
        <p>
        I also like to use my creativity and problem solving in my spare time.  I do this through cake decorating, board gaming, and video gaming.
